Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to investigate various aspects of the datasets and derive meaningful insights through exploratory data analysis and regression modeling.

Dataset Descriptions

Part 1: Automobile MPG Analysis
Dataset: auto-mpg.csv

Description: Analyzed the relationship between vehicle attributes and fuel efficiency (MPG).
Key Variables: Horsepower, Weight, Cylinder Count, Displacement, Acceleration, MPG.
Part 2: Call Center Data Analysis
Dataset: Call_Center.csv

Description: Explored customer satisfaction, call duration impact, and primary reasons for customer calls.
Key Variables: Call Duration, CSAT Score, Call Reasons.
Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Part 1: Automobile MPG Analysis
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and ensured accuracy for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized relationships, notably between horsepower and MPG.
Modeling: Performed simple and multiple linear regression analyses.
Part 2: Call Center Data Analysis
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values in CSAT scores.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Examined distribution of CSAT scores and relationship with call duration.
Insights: Analyzed primary reasons for customer calls.
Model Results

Part 1: Automobile MPG Analysis
Simple Linear Regression:
R-squared: 0.611
Adjusted R-squared: 0.604
Equation: MPG = 35.31 - 0.13 * Horsepower
Multiple Linear Regression:
R-squared: 0.762
Adjusted R-squared: 0.745
Equation: MPG = 38.9644 - 0.4973 * Cylinder - 0.0098 * Displacement - 0.0039 * Weight - 0.0579 * Acceleration
Part 2: Call Center Data Analysis
CSAT Score Distribution: Mean CSAT Score: 5.55
Call Duration vs. CSAT: Correlation coefficient of -0.006, indicating negligible relationship.
Visualization

Visualizations were created using Tableau Public to enhance the interpretability of the data.

Scatterplot: Shows the relationship between car name, horsepower, and weight.
Packed Bubbles: Illustrates car name, cylinder count, and weight.
Bar Graph: Compares car name, horsepower, and MPG.

Conclusion

The project reveals key insights into automobile fuel efficiency and customer satisfaction trends. While the multiple regression model for MPG provided a strong explanation of variance, the call center analysis indicated limited impact of call duration on customer satisfaction.
